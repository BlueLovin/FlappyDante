# <b>FlappyDante</b>
Flappy Bird clone with my dog, written in C# with the MonoGame Framework. Smooth jumping mechanics, good collision detection. All with simple code. There are only two pipes, but you would not have known that if I didn't tell you. They have randomly generated heights. Every time one goes off screen, it comes out the other side to make it look like a new pipe, and possibly save memory.
